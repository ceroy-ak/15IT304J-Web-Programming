<p align="'left">
	Job seekers face a lot of issues while maintaining records of all the oncampus and offcampus applications they have applied in an efficient and visualized way. All the applications will be visible by priority set by the job seekers and other constraints accordingly and will have data for observations like test score, job titles with more success to make more informed decision in future application process. In the proposed Job application tracker, the applicants can enter Application details like Company Name, Job Title, Job Description, Application Date and Application Status. The applicants will be able to sort and track the status of the application and will get email reminders for the same. Applicants can even make question bank of questions asked during the process and can view it during the next job process.  A separated page will list out all the open job applications as per the API response from Job Boards.
